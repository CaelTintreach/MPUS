# Risk Assessment Retrospective

In this document I will provide a brief overview of the risk assessment carried out for SFIA Project 1 (MPUS).



I personally feel happy with the content covered by the risk assessment but feel that if I had accounted for 'closer to home' problems then it might have been complete and actually identified the problem I faced in development in actually acquiring my medication.
